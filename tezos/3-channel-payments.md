# Channel Payments

A customer wishes to purchase a good or service from the merchant using their zkChannel with channel identifier `cid`. We denote the good or service by `x` in the description below and the cost is an amount `amt`.

1. The customer sends a _payment request message_ containing the tuple `(x, amt)` to the merchant.
2. The merchant checks the payment request message and decides whether to accept or reject. If the former, they send `accept`; if the latter, they send `reject` and abort.
3. Upon receipt of `reject`, the customer aborts the session. Upon receipt of `accept`, the customer and merchant run `zkAbacus.Pay()` for amount `amt`. (The customer must use their current channel state data to process this payment, and the merchant must have read and write access to their [revocation database](1-setup.md#Revocation-database-initialization) `revocation_DB` and their [blind signing key](1-setup.md#Blind-signing-key-generation).


4. The merchant receives a success indicator from `zkAbacus.Pay()`, which can be used to decide whether or not the requested service should be provided:

    * If the merchant receives `‚ä•`, the payment has unequivocably failed. No good or service should be provided.

    * If the merchant receives `revocation-incomplete`, then if `amt` represents a negative value (i.e., the payment request is for a refund), the merchant should consider the payment complete. This is because, in this case, the customer has a way to close on their updated state, in which the refund has been successfully applied. If `amt` represents a positive value, the merchant should consider the payment incomplete and no service should be provided.

	* If the merchant receives `revocation-complete`, then the merchant should consider the payment complete. In this case, the customer can no longer close on the previous state. In this case, the merchant should provide the requested service.


5. The customer also receives a success indicator from `zkAbacuz.Pay()` and does the following:
    * If the customer receives `revocation-incomplete`, the customer sets their channel status to `frozen` and initiates a [unilateral customer close](4-channel-closure.md##unilateral-customer-close) on their current state.
    * If the customer receives `revocation-complete`, the customer sets their channel status to `frozen` and initiates a[unilateral customer close](4-channel-closure.md#unilateral-customer-close) on the updated state, the balances of which reflect a payment of amount `amt`.
    * If the customer receives `state-updated`, then the customer should expect to receive the requested good or service, and may continue to make additional payments on the channel.
